# Architecture — how CARE Clinic works

This explains the moving parts: the app, the engine, the container stack, and how
a request flows. For *changing* settings see [configuration.md](configuration.md).

---

## Two layers

### 1. The control layer (one Go program)
A single Go codebase (`app/`) ships in two forms that share one **engine**:

- **Desktop app** (Wails) — a native window with an installer wizard and a control
  panel. For non-technical staff.
- **`care` CLI** — the same actions from a terminal. For developers/servers.

The **engine** (`app/internal/care/`) is plain Go that shells out to `docker` and
`git`. It has no GUI dependency, so the app and CLI can never drift. It replaced
the old `care.sh` bash script entirely — there is **no shell dependency** on any OS.

What the engine does:

| Action | What happens |
|---|---|
| `setup` | generate a Django secret → clone + build the backend and frontend images → set up `care.local` |
| `start` | ensure images exist → `docker compose up -d` → run DB migrations → create the default admin |
| `stop` / `restart` | stop / restart containers (data always preserved) |
| `rebuild-backend` | rebuild the backend image from new code, recreate + migrate |
| `rebuild-frontend` | rebuild the frontend image (Vite bakes settings at build time) |
| `status` | report each container's state |
| `backup-now` | write an immediate database dump |
| `list-backups` | list the restorable points in the backup folder |
| `restore` | stop app services → drop + re-create the DB from a chosen dump → (optionally) overwrite the MinIO volume from the matching files archive → bring the stack back up + migrate |
| `uninstall` | `compose down -v` (containers + network + **data volumes**) → optionally remove images → delete the clones + kit dir → optionally delete backups. The app also clears its config + login-item so the next launch is a fresh first-run |

### 2. The runtime layer (Docker containers)
The actual CARE stack, defined in `docker-compose.yml`. Project name is
**`care-clinic`** so it never collides with another CARE stack on the same machine.

| Service | Image | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `db` | `postgres:17-alpine` | the database (patient records, etc.) |
| `redis` | `redis:8-alpine` | cache + Celery task queue |
| `minio` | `minio/minio` | S3-compatible file storage (uploads, X-rays, logos) |
| `backend` | `care:clinic` (built) | the Django API + `/admin` |
| `celery-worker` | `care:clinic` | background jobs |
| `celery-beat` | `care:clinic` | scheduled jobs |
| `frontend` | `care_fe:clinic` (built) | the React app (served by nginx) |
| `caddy` | `caddy:2` | reverse proxy — the single front door on port 80 |
| `backup` | `postgres:17-alpine` | daily DB dump + file archive |

Only **two ports** are exposed to the WiFi:
- **80** — the app + API, via Caddy.
- **9100** — MinIO, for direct file upload/download (presigned URLs).

Everything else (postgres 5432, redis 6379, the backend's 9000) is private inside
the Docker network.

## How a request flows

A nurse opens `http://care.local` on her phone:

1. **Name → address.** The phone asks the LAN "who is `care.local`?" — **mDNS**
   (Bonjour/Avahi) answers with the server's IP. No internet, no router config.
2. **Phone → Caddy.** It connects to the server on **port 80**, hitting Caddy (the
   reverse proxy / single front door).
3. **Caddy routes by path** (`Caddyfile`):
   - `/api/*`, `/admin/*`, `/static/*`, `/ping/*`, `/health/*` → **backend:9000**
   - everything else → **frontend:80** (the React app)
4. **The React app runs in the phone** and calls `/api/...` at the **same address**
   (`http://care.local`) — so it's *same-origin*, and there's **no CORS** to deal with.
5. **Backend talks to** postgres (data) + redis (cache/jobs) and returns JSON.
6. **Files** (X-rays, documents) use **presigned URLs**: the browser uploads/
   downloads **directly** to MinIO at `http://care.local:9100`. (This is why
   `BUCKET_EXTERNAL_ENDPOINT` must be a name every device can reach — never
   `localhost`.)

---

## Plain HTTP on the LAN (`clinic_settings.py`)

CARE's production settings assume HTTPS. On a trusted offline LAN we use plain
`http://`, so `clinic_settings.py` imports the production settings and relaxes only
the HTTPS-only guards:

```python
from config.settings.deployment import *
DEBUG = False                   # never debug on a clinic box
SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT = False     # don't bounce LAN http → https
SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE = False   # let /admin + CSRF cookies work over http
CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE = False
SECURE_HSTS_SECONDS = 0
CORS_ALLOW_ALL_ORIGINS = True   # the proxy is same-origin anyway
```

It's mounted into the backend container at `/settings/` and selected with
`DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=clinic_settings`. **The core CARE app is never modified.**

---

## Why the frontend is built locally

The frontend (`care_fe`) is a **Vite** app: it **bakes** `REACT_CARE_API_URL` into
the static files at *build* time, and its build validator rejects an empty value.
The official prebuilt image points at CARE's cloud API — useless for an offline
clinic. So setup **builds the frontend once**, pinned to `http://care.local`. The
backend, by contrast, reads its settings at runtime, so it could use any image — but
for now both are built from source (branch `develop`).

See [configuration.md](configuration.md#versionsenv) for pinning versions.

## Where things live on the server

| Path (macOS shown) | What |
|---|---|
| `~/Library/Application Support/care-clinic/config.json` | the app's saved choices (setup done, install/backup folders) |
| `~/Library/Application Support/care-clinic/kit/` | the unpacked deployment kit + the `care`/`care_fe` clones |
| `~/Desktop/care-db-backups/` (default) | daily backups (override in the installer) |
| Docker named volumes | `postgres-data`, `redis-data`, `minio-data`, `caddy-*` — the actual data |

On Linux the config dir is `~/.config/care-clinic/`; on Windows it's
`%AppData%\care-clinic\`.

> **Patient data lives in the Docker volumes**, not in the install folder. The
> install folder only holds the kit + source clones. This is why moving/clearing the
> install folder never loses data — but you must still back up the volumes (the
> `backup` container does this automatically).
